# Homework-3

The purpose of this project was to build a random password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The criteria for success were as follows:

* Create a dynamic and responsive HTML document with CSS and JavaScript.
* Users should be prompted to answer questions about their desired password. 

The bonus objective of the project was to have a functioning button that allowed the user to copy the newly generated password to their clipboard. 

## Getting Started

The deployed project should look like this.

### Development

I will now attempt to enumerate the steps I took in the development of this project. 

1. Created index.html, style1.css, and script.js. 

2. General HTML document structure added to index.html. 

3. Bootstrap styling, style1.css, and script.js linked to index.html. 

4. Card template and contact info template from bootstrap merged and implemented in index.html for desired appearance. 

5. Created initial variables that I knew I would need in script.js (length of password, special characters, numbers, upper and lower case letters).
